# Estimating transmission rates of different *Mtb* lineages in Tanzania using phylodynamics
This repository contains the code associated with the phylodynamic analyses performed in Zwyer, Rutaihwa, Windels et al. (2023) "Back-to-Africa introductions of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* as the main cause of tuberculosis in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania", PLOS Pathogens (in press).

These analyses aimed at estimating the transmission rate of different *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* lineages (introductions), by fitting a birth-death model to genomic sequencing data collected from TB patients in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (2013-2019).

The raw sequencing data used in this study are available under project accession number XXXXX.
